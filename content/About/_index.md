The SF Nexus comprises a collaborative network of research and public libraries with collections of SF. While the SF Nexus is based at Temple University’s Charles Library, we are committed to growing our capabilities as a SF-focused collective research community. 

The SF Nexus aspires to make a comprehensive dataset of science fiction literature. At this time, the most valuable web resources include:
* [**Project Gutenberg**](https://www.gutenberg.org/): A library containing 70,000+ free ebooks for which U.S. copyright has expired.
* [**Internet Archive**](https://archive.org/): A non-profit library containing millions of free books, movies, and music, as well as billions of archived web pages; books out of copyright are available to download.
* [**Luminist.org**](http://www.luminist.org/archives/SF/): A variety of cultural documents, including science fiction, fantasy and "weird fiction," available for download and purhcase: 

A future goal is to develop a dataset combining materials from these sources. Separately, work is ongoing to digitize old paperbacks and pulp magazines at institutions like Temple University Library. This hub will also help to make those copyrighted materials available, for example, as derived datasets of extracted features like those available from HathiTrust. 

## Our Core SF Archive: Paskow Science Fiction Collection, Temple University Special Collections Research Center
The [Loretta C. Duckworth Scholars Studio](https://library.temple.edu/lcdss) has partnered with [Temple University Libraries’ Special Collections Research Center (SCRC)](https://library.temple.edu/scrc) and [Digital Library Initiatives (DLI)](https://digital.library.temple.edu/) to build a digitized corpus of copyrighted science fiction literature. Besides its voluminous [Urban Archives](https://library.temple.edu/collections/urban-archives), the SCRC also houses a significant collection of science-fiction literature. The [Paskow Science Fiction Collection](https://library.temple.edu/collections/paskow-science-fiction-collection-science-fiction-and-fantasy) was originally established in 1972, when Temple acquired 5,000 science fiction paperbacks from a Temple alumnus, the late David C. Paskow. Subsequent donations, including troves of fanzines and the papers of such sci-fi writers as John Varley and Stanley G. Weinbaum, expanded the collection over the last few decades, both in size and in the range of genres. SCRC staff and undergraduate student workers recently performed the usual comparison of gift titles against cataloged books, removing science fiction items that were exact duplicates of existing holdings. A refocusing of the SCRC’s collection development policy for science fiction de-emphasized fantasy and horror titles, so some titles in those genres were removed as well.

For an overview of our approach to data curation of literary texts, see Alex Wermer-Colan's and James Kopaczewski's article, ["The New Wave of Digital Collections: Speculating on the Future of Library Curation"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/45420508#metadata_info_tab_contents)(2022)

Further effort will be made to share code for analyzing sf data.

## Ingesting Our SF Archive into HathiTrust Digital Library
Temple has ingested over 300 science fiction texts into the HathiTrust Digital Library. Because [HathiTrust requires specific file formats](https://www.hathitrust.org/submission-package-requirements-digitized-content-submitted-to-hathitrust) for upload, Python code was used to packaged all necessary files for the sf collection. Running the Python ingestion code in the command line generated the following files for upload to HathiTrust:

* Image files (TIFF) for each page of each title (duplicated from server)
* OCR files for each page of each title (generated by Google Tesseract)
* Metadata file (YML) containing administrative and technical metadata
* Checksum file listing every file in package and its corresponding md5 hash value

The ingestion code and associated tutorial are available on our [HathiTrust-Ingestion-Scripts Github Repository](https://github.com/SF-Nexus/HathiTrust-Ingestion-Scripts).
